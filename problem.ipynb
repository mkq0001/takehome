The signals labeled as 'f_?' are considered to be company fundamental characteristics that evolve gradually, while those labeled as 's_?' are derived from either market data or alternative data sources. The signals, similar to the returns, are observed at the market close each day. Predict the returns of these 200 assets on date d_1000."
