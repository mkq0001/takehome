These signals are labeled as \"f_?\" and \"s_?\", and they may be derived from company fundamentals, market data, or alternative data sources. The signals exhibit varying turnover rates and autocorrelation structures. Like the returns, the signals are observed at the market close each day. Your task is to predict the returns of the 200 assets for the date d_0400."
